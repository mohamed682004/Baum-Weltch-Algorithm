# Baum-Welch Algorithm Research and Implementation

This repository showcases a second-year college research project exploring the Baum-Welch algorithm. Conducted as part of a **Stochastic Processes** course, this project delves into the theory and practical application of the algorithm using R. The Baum-Welch algorithm, a key Expectation-Maximization (EM) technique, is essential for parameter estimation in Hidden Markov Models (HMMs).

## About the Baum-Welch Algorithm

The Baum-Welch algorithm was developed by Leonard E. Baum and Lloyd R. Welch and is a fundamental method for estimating the parameters of HMMs using observed data. It iteratively adjusts transition and emission probabilities to maximize the likelihood of a given sequence of observations.

### Key Features:
- **Expectation Step (E-Step):** Calculates forward and backward probabilities to estimate expected counts for transitions and emissions.
- **Maximization Step (M-Step):** Updates the parameters of the HMM based on expected counts.
- **Applications:** Speech recognition, computational biology, and financial modeling.

### Theoretical Background
Included in this repository is a detailed write-up explaining:
- Forward and backward algorithms
